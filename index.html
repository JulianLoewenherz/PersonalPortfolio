                    <h3> Introduction </h3>
                    Hello, I'm Julian Loewenherz, a Dual Degree program student at SFU. 
                    I am currently studying my undergraduate degree in computer science
                    and in 2026 will be attending Zhejiang University for a masters in finance.   
                    <h3> Passions </h3>
                    My academic journey has led me to develop a strong interest in the intersection 
                    of computer science and economics. I am passionate about leveraging technology 
                    to solve real world problems in these fields. 
                    <h3> Goals </h3>
                    my primary goals include securing an internship in the fintech industry to further my
                    experience and deepen my knowledge in the field.
                    <h3>Mentorship</h3>
                    I am always eager to learn more about computer science, finance, and economics.  
                    If you have any industry insights or recommendations for reading materials in these areas, 
                    please feel free to send me an email. I am actively looking for a mentor 
                    who can guide me in these subjects and help me achieve my career aspirations.
